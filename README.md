Problem Statement:
Contextual Chat Bot:

Mandatory Requirements:

Simple Contextual Chat Bot
1. Read a long PDF/ Word Document. 
2. Build a chat bot that will use the document as a context to answer the question. 
3. If the answer is not found in the document - it should say I don't know the answer. 

Advanced Challenge:
- Break down the document into multiple chunks/ paragraphs. 
- Store them in a vector database like pinecone.  
- When you ask a question find out the top 3 chunks that will likely have the answer to the question using semantic similarity search.
